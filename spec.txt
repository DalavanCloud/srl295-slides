Intl as in Internationalization: Tools for Global Node.js Applications

Node.js is the fastest-growing platform ever for back-end, front-end, and IoT devices. The world,
 though, is made of people who speak many languages.

The “Intl” API has been available to Node.js users since v0.12.  This talk will cover ECMA-402 
in the history of JavaScript internationalization, methods of packaging application data,
 and available libraries. As with the interest in consistent front/back end practices, we 
 will look at what’s available on the browser side.
