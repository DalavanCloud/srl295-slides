Node.js has become a popular platform, using JavaScript on the server, or in other environments outside of its traditional role in web browsers. This presentation will discuss the latest status in enabling and making use of the Intl (EcmaScript-402) module support in Node.js, the status of the library ecosystem, and what's next for JavaScript and Node.js globalization with upcoming features slated for future EcmaScript-402 and EcmaScript-262 editions and discuss techniques and best practices for Unicode and international support in Node.js applications.
